# Spice Simulation and STA using BIGSPICY

bigspicy is a tool for merging circuit descriptions (netlists), generating Spice decks modeling those circuits, generating Spice tests to measure those models, and analyzing the results of running Spice on those tests.
## Tools Required

- ``` Icarius Verilog ```
- ``` Python3 ```
- ``` Xdm ``` tool for converting the spice files to ``` xyce ``` format.
- ``` bigspicy ``` for making a single circuit protobuf
- ``` xyce ``` for performing test

## Installation of tools

### Icarius verilog

``` 
sudo apt-get install iverilog
```
